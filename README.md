# AI-BOM Inspector

This site highlights **AI-BOM Inspector**, a tool for surfacing security, license, and health insights from software bills of materials (SBOMs). The homepage introduces the value of the tool, its core capabilities, and how it fits into supply chain workflows.

The site runs on GitHub Pages using the `jekyll-theme-slate` theme with custom brand accents to match the AI-BOM Inspector look and feel.
